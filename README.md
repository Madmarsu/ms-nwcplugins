# ms-nwcplugins
These are my user plugin objects for Noteworty Composer (NWC). A plugin architecture was added to this program for version 2.75, allowing add-ins that are drawn and/or played in the score at the desired location. Please refer to the API for this architecture, which can be found here: https://github.com/nwsw/nwcplugin-api
